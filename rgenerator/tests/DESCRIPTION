Description: This package provides tools to apply the Adequacy patch on an
	Antares study.
	It provides functions to import: 
		- an Antares study, and in particular the time-steps where at least one
			country is in loss of load
		- the flow-based related files (time-serires, weigths and second-members)
		- the NTC links, formatted like the flow-based ones
	It also defines the main Adequacy patch function, taking the previously
	imported data and applying the following rules: 
		- Local matching: a country in loss of load cannot be globally exporting
			(it can on certain of its borders though)
		- Curtailment sharing: the "curtailment ratios" of countries in loss of
			load should be relatively close
	The optimization process of the patch is delegated to the optimization
	modelling langugage AMPL, and to the solver XPRESS.
